In the streaming literature, query language model a stream as a representation for an infinite append-only relation. The append-only stream model effects the following limitations\citep{Ghanem:2008}
\begin{itemize}
\item It limits the applicability of the language since the append-only models cannot represent streams from the various domain( e.g., the update streams or streams that represent concatenation of the states of a fixed size relation).
\item The append-only stream model limits the types of queries that the language can express since only non-blocking queries can produce append-only streams as output
\item The semantics of query composition in the append-only stream model is complex and the meaning of the composed queries is difficult to understand.
\end{itemize}
